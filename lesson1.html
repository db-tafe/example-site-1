    <h1><b>Thinking in HTML</b></h1>

    <p>HTML originated from a prototype created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. Berners-Lee felt that
        there was a possibility of linking documents together by the use of hypertext, and the concept
        of HTML evolved. The drawback was that the commercial hypertext packages available at that
        time, such as Zog and Intermedia, were customized to suit different types of computers and
        were too ambiguous in nature.</p>

    <p>Berners-Lee developed <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b>, and in conjunction, he
        developed a protocol to access text from other documents via hyperlinks. The protocol was
        called <b>HTTP</b>, and this paved the way for the future. HTML itself was derived from a markup
        language called <b>Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</b>.</p>

    <p>Standardization being an ongoing process, modifications were constantly made and
        versions were released accordingly. The various versions of HTML that have been released
        are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML 2.0 (November 1995)</li>
            <li>HTML 3.2 (January 1997)</li>
            <li>HTML 4.0 (December 1997)</li>
            <li>HTML 4.01 (December 1999)</li>
            <li>HTML5, which is widely used, but is still in the development stage</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Another breakthrough in the field was the introduction of CSS along with HTML 4.0. Prior to
        the introduction of CSS, web designers and developers used HTML for formatting purposes.
        Formatting and styling a web page using HTML defeats the purpose of HTML, because HTML
        elements and attributes must only define the structure of the web page. The purpose of CSS
        was to separate styling out from structural markup. With the introduction of CSS, we could
        separate presentation from content. As a result, formatting could be separated from the HTML
        document and stored in a separate file, which could then be included in the document using a
        <code>link tag.</code></p>
